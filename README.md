<h2> 
  To-Do List Project
</h2>

This repo contains a basic architecture for a To-Do list app. It consists of a modular backend handling the list operations (like add/delete task, mark as done etc...) that can be accessed either by a CLI- or GUI-frontend and a sqlite database layer that communicates with the backend to retrieve/manipulate the stored data.
